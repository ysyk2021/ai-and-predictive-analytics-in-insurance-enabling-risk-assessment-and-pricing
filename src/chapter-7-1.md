Emerging Trends and Technologies in AI-Based Predictive Analytics in Insurance
=========================================================================================================================

AI-based predictive analytics is rapidly transforming the insurance industry, but there are still emerging trends and technologies that will shape its future. In this chapter, we will explore these trends and technologies, as well as the challenges they present.

Emerging Trends in AI-Based Predictive Analytics in Insurance
-------------------------------------------------------------

### Internet of Things (IoT)

The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the interconnectivity of devices and sensors that can collect data on everything from traffic patterns to health metrics. In insurance, IoT can be used to gather data on everything from driving behavior to home maintenance, which can inform risk assessment and pricing decisions.

### Blockchain

Blockchain technology provides a secure and transparent way to store and share data. In insurance, blockchain can be used to securely store customer data, policy information, and claims history. This can improve efficiency and reduce costs by eliminating the need for intermediaries.

### Explainable AI

Explainable AI refers to the ability to explain how AI-based models make decisions. This is important for the insurance industry, as it can help ensure that decisions are transparent and ethical.
